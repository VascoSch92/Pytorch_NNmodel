# Neural network for tabular data (Pytorch_lightning)

The repository contains the two basic classes to construct a neural network model with Pytorch lightning starting from tabular data. 
The script NNdataset.py contains the code to create a dataset, while the script NNmodel.py contains the code to create a neural network model. 

Let me know if you have any advice (or criticism) on how to improve the code
