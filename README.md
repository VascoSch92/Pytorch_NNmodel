# Neural network for tabular data with pytprch lightning

The repository includes two classes for constructing a neural network model for tabular data using PyTorch Lightning. The script NNdataset.py comprises the code for generating a dataset, while the script NNmodel.py encompasses the code for building a neural network model.

Feel free to share any advice or constructive criticism you may have to enhance the code.
